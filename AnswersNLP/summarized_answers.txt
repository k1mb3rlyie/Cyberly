Summary 6: a blended attack is a sophisticated form of cyberattack that combines multiple techniques to compromise a target . these attacks are particularly dangerous because they exploit multiple vulnerabilities simultaneously making them harder to detect and defend against . the attacks are especially dangerous because it exploits multiple vulnerabilities .
Summary 7: internal threats are security risks that come from within an organization typically involving employees or trusted insiders . external threats originate from outside the organization and are typically carried out by hackers or cybercriminals using malware phishing or other attack methods .
Summary 8: an Advanced Persistent Threat APT is a sophisticated targeted cyberattack that aims to infiltrate a specific organization or nation and maintain longterm access to its systems without being detected .
