Summary 1: personal data such as medical financial and educational records can lead to identity theft fraud and significant emotional and financial stress for individuals For organizations breaches of intellectual property customer data or financial information can result in lost business lawsuits and reputational damage For example the Equifax breach compromised the sensitive information of millions of people leading to lawsuits a loss of trust and significant financial penalties for the company Organizations also risk losing competitive advantages if trade secrets or product plans are stolen potentially affecting their longterm survival 
Summary 2: the CIA Triad is foundational to cybersecurity Confidentiality ensures that sensitive data is accessible only to authorized users often through encryption or access control systems . hospitals protect patient records using encryption Integrity guarantees that data remains accurate and unaltered often checked through mechanisms like hashing . a bank must ensure that its online banking services are always available even during peak hours Balancing these is critical because a focus on one area eg high availability without considering
Summary 3: ransomware works by encrypting files on a victims system and demanding payment for the decryption key . it can paralyze businesses as seen in the 2017 WannaCry attack which affected hospitals and businesses worldwide Spyware such as keyloggers silently records user activity including passwords and financial information which can be sold or used for fraud Worms like the Conficker worm selfreplicate and spread across networks causing widespread disruptions
Summary 4: a phishing email might tell the recipient that their account is compromised and ask them to click a link to reset their password This link leads to a fake website designed to capture their login credentials Phishing often relies on creating a sense of urgency to provoke an immediate less cautious response Pretexting An attacker fabricates a scenario a pretext to deceive a target For example an attacker might pose as tech support and claim they need access to the
Summary 5: Denial of Service DoS attacks are designed to overwhelm a network system or service rendering it unavailable to users . attacks involve sending an excessive amount of traffic to a target system from a single source effectively clogging the systems resources . attackers may flood a web server with an overwhelming number of requests slowing it down or crashing it . the attacks are more complex and harder to defend against because they involve multiple sources often a botnet which is a
Summary 6: blended attacks combine multiple techniques such as viruses worms phishing and denial of service to compromise a target . attacker could launch a DDoS attack to distract the organizations security team and delay their response . Defending against blended attacks requires comprehensive security strategies including email filtering endpoint protection and robust monitoring systems to detect suspicious activity across various layers of the IT infrastructure . the attacker could then use these credentials to gain access to a corporate network and deploy 
Summary 7: internal threats are security risks that come from within an organization typically involving employees or trusted insiders who have authorized access to systems These threats can be accidental eg an employee inadvertently clicking on a malicious link . an insider with malicious intent stealing sensitive data External threats originate from outside the organization and are typically carried out by hackers or cybercriminals using malware phishing or other attack methods Internal threats are harder to detect because the malicious activity may look
Summary 8: an Advanced Persistent Threat APT is a sophisticated targeted cyberattack that aims to infiltrate a specific organization or nation and maintain longterm access to its systems without being detected . targets include initial infiltration Attackers gain entry through methods like phishing exploiting a vulnerability or using compromised credentials The goal is to establish a foothold in the target system Establishing an foothold The attacker deploys malware eg a rootkit or back
