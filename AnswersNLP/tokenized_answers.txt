Failing to protect personal data such as medical financial and educational records can lead to identity theft fraud and significant emotional and financial stress for individuals For organizations breaches of intellectual property customer data or financial information can result in lost business lawsuits and reputational damage For example the Equifax breach compromised the sensitive information of millions of people leading to lawsuits a loss of trust and significant financial penalties for the company Organizations also risk losing competitive advantages if trade secrets or product plans are stolen potentially affecting their longterm survival
The CIA Triad is foundational to cybersecurity Confidentiality ensures that sensitive data is accessible only to authorized users often through encryption or access control systems For example hospitals protect patient records using encryption Integrity guarantees that data remains accurate and unaltered often checked through mechanisms like hashing An example is file verification during downloads Availability ensures that data is available when needed which can be achieved through redundancy and failover systems For instance a bank must ensure that its online banking services are always available even during peak hours Balancing these is critical because a focus on one area eg high availability without considering others eg confidentiality could result in vulnerabilities
Ransomware works by encrypting files on a victims system and demanding payment for the decryption key It can paralyze businesses as seen in the 2017 WannaCry attack which affected hospitals and businesses worldwide Spyware such as keyloggers silently records user activity including passwords and financial information which can be sold or used for fraud Worms like the Conficker worm selfreplicate and spread across networks causing widespread disruptions While ransomware impacts an organization by holding critical data hostage spyware compromises sensitive information and worms can cause network congestion and degrade performance
Phishing Pretexting Baiting
Denial of Service DoS and Distributed Denial of Service DDoS attacks are designed to overwhelm a network system or service rendering it unavailable to users
A blended attack is a sophisticated form of cyberattack that combines multiple techniquesâsuch as viruses worms phishing and denial of serviceâto compromise a target These attacks are particularly dangerous because they exploit multiple vulnerabilities simultaneously making them harder to detect and defend against
Internal threats are security risks that come from within an organization typically involving employees or trusted insiders who have authorized access to systems These threats can be accidental eg an employee inadvertently clicking on a malicious link or intentional eg an insider with malicious intent stealing sensitive data External threats on the other hand originate from outside the organization and are typically carried out by hackers or cybercriminals using malware phishing or other attack methods
An Advanced Persistent Threat APT is a sophisticated targeted cyberattack that aims to infiltrate a specific organization or nation and maintain longterm access to its systems without being detected Unlike regular cyberattacks that seek quick gains APTs are carefully planned highly funded and involve multiple phases They are often carried out by nationstates or highly organized groups targeting critical infrastructure government agencies or large corporations Initial Infiltration Establishing a foothold Lateral movement Data exfiltration Covering tracks
