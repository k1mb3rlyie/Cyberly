Ransomware works by encrypting files on a victims system and demanding payment for the decryption key 1
Ransomware paralyzes systems by encrypting data and holding it hostage until a payment is made 1
Spyware steals sensitive data by recording user activity such as keystrokes and passwords and can be sold or used for fraud 1
Worms like the Conficker worm replicate themselves spreading across networks and causing widespread disruptions 1
Ransomware spyware and worms all disrupt organizations by either stealing data holding it hostage or slowing down networks 1
Each of these cyber threats impacts organizations differently whether by compromising sensitive information or overwhelming network resources 1
Ransomware does not encrypt files but instead steals them directly for financial gain 0
Spyware generally spreads through systems via email and overwhelms the systemâs memory 0
Worms do not replicate themselves but stay on one device to perform attacks 0
Ransomware is harmless unless the victim agrees to pay the ransom in which case they might lose money 0
Worms typically only affect specific industries and are not a concern for most organizations 0
Spyware causes network slowdowns and is easily identifiable by system administrators 0
Spyware and ransomware are interchangeable since they both affect networks similarly 0
Phishing involves sending fraudulent emails that appear to come from legitimate sources tricking recipients into giving up their credentials 1
Phishing often uses urgent messages to trick users into revealing sensitive information such as passwords 1
Phishing emails direct victims to fake websites that capture their login information 1
Pretexting involves creating a false scenario to deceive someone into providing access to sensitive data or systems 1
Baiting tricks victims into downloading malicious software by offering something enticing such as free downloads 1
All these social engineering techniques rely on deception and manipulating human trust to gain unauthorized access 1
Phishing emails rarely use urgency to prompt immediate action from the victim 0
Pretexting uses technical flaws in systems rather than deception to trick users 0
Baiting typically involves using infected devices directly connected to the network not through social manipulation 0
Phishing relies only on technological vulnerabilities not human error or manipulation 0
Baiting is rare because most people can recognize malware easily and donât fall for tricks 0
Pretexting is primarily a technical threat and rarely involves impersonation or human deception 0
Phishing does not typically lead victims to fake websites but to compromised official websites 0
DoS and DDoS attacks are designed to overwhelm networks systems or services making them unavailable to legitimate users 1
DoS attacks come from a single source making it easier to trace and block 1
DDoS attacks involve multiple sources often botnets making them harder to defend against 1
DDoS attacks flood systems with excessive traffic slowing down or crashing the target system 1
Mitigating DDoS attacks involves using traffic filtering CDNs and rate limiting to prevent overloads 1
DDoS attacks are more complex than DoS because they come from multiple distributed sources making them harder to block 1
DoS attacks do not overwhelm networks but rather target specific files or software on the system 0
DDoS attacks can be easily traced and blocked due to the large number of sources involved 0
DoS attacks are much harder to trace compared to DDoS because they involve fewer sources 0
Traffic filtering has no effect on DDoS attacks as the traffic is too distributed to manage effectively 0
DDoS attacks are much less dangerous than DoS since they use botnets that are slower and easier to detect 0
Organizations donât need a specific response plan for DDoS attacks as their systems can handle traffic spikes automatically 0
DDoS attacks are simple to defend against since only one component of the network is usually affected 0
Encryption is the process of converting plain text into an unreadable format to protect data from unauthorized access 1
Encryption ensures that only authorized parties can read sensitive data by converting it into an unreadable format 1
Encryption algorithms like AES are widely used to secure communications by encoding data 1
Encryption prevents unauthorized users from accessing or altering sensitive information by scrambling the data 1
Encryption works by transforming readable data into code that can only be decoded with the correct key 1
Encryption makes sure that only people with the right key can understand the data 1
Encryption doesnât affect the readability of the data and only adds a layer of access control 0
Encryption is primarily used to stop data from being permanently lost rather than securing its contents 0
Encryption involves converting data into a more readable format for external users 0
Encryption is only relevant when sending data over public networks like the internet 0
Encryption is primarily used to backup data making it recoverable in case of damage 0
Encryption mainly helps compress files so that they take up less storage 0
