Failing to protect personal data such as medical, financial, and educational records can lead to identity theft, fraud, and significant emotional and financial stress for individuals. For organizations, breaches of intellectual property, customer data, or financial information can result in lost business, lawsuits, and reputational damage. For example, the Equifax breach compromised the sensitive information of millions of people, leading to lawsuits, a loss of trust, and significant financial penalties for the company. Organizations also risk losing competitive advantages if trade secrets or product plans are stolen, potentially affecting their long-term survival.
The CIA Triad is foundational to cybersecurity. Confidentiality ensures that sensitive data is accessible only to authorized users, often through encryption or access control systems. For example, hospitals protect patient records using encryption. Integrity guarantees that data remains accurate and unaltered, often checked through mechanisms like hashing. An example is file verification during downloads. Availability ensures that data is available when needed, which can be achieved through redundancy and failover systems. For instance, a bank must ensure that its online banking services are always available, even during peak hours. Balancing these is critical because a focus on one area (e.g., high availability) without considering others (e.g., confidentiality) could result in vulnerabilities.
Ransomware works by encrypting files on a victim's system and demanding payment for the decryption key. It can paralyze businesses, as seen in the 2017 WannaCry attack, which affected hospitals and businesses worldwide. Spyware, such as keyloggers, silently records user activity, including passwords and financial information, which can be sold or used for fraud. Worms like the Conficker worm self-replicate and spread across networks, causing widespread disruptions. While ransomware impacts an organization by holding critical data hostage, spyware compromises sensitive information, and worms can cause network congestion and degrade performance.
Phishing, Pretexting, Baiting
Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are designed to overwhelm a network, system, or service, rendering it unavailable to users.
A blended attack is a sophisticated form of cyberattack that combines multiple techniques—such as viruses, worms, phishing, and denial of service—to compromise a target. These attacks are particularly dangerous because they exploit multiple vulnerabilities simultaneously, making them harder to detect and defend against.
Internal threats are security risks that come from within an organization, typically involving employees or trusted insiders who have authorized access to systems. These threats can be accidental (e.g., an employee inadvertently clicking on a malicious link) or intentional (e.g., an insider with malicious intent stealing sensitive data). External threats, on the other hand, originate from outside the organization and are typically carried out by hackers or cybercriminals using malware, phishing, or other attack methods.
An Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is a sophisticated, targeted cyberattack that aims to infiltrate a specific organization or nation and maintain long-term access to its systems without being detected. Unlike regular cyberattacks that seek quick gains, APTs are carefully planned, highly funded, and involve multiple phases. They are often carried out by nation-states or highly organized groups targeting critical infrastructure, government agencies, or large corporations.
